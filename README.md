 ## Summary
 In this notebook, I analyze the pacing of the anime series One Piece. I use datasets from Kaggle to gather information about the arcs of the series, including their names, average ratings, and number of episodes. I then created a new metric called ***adapt ratio***, which compares the time spent in the manga (source material) versus the anime adaptation. I also included visualizations to showcase the pacing of the arcs throughout the series and especially how things slow down post time-skip. Time-skips in One Piece refer to a gap of time in the story where a significant amount of time has passed but it was not shown in the series. I conclude that the pacing of the arcs in One Piece has slowed down as the series progressed, and provide visualizations to show a reader who may have no prior knowledge how this may be. This notebook provides a unique perspective on the pacing of One Piece and offers insights into the storytelling and structure of the series.
