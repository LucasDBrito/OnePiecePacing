By using two datasets from Kaggle and creating your own, I have analyzed the pacing of the arcs throughout the show. Specifically, you have shown how the arcs have become slower later in the series by displaying the amount of time each arc takes up in the overall show. These visualizations provide a unique perspective on the pacing of One Piece and offer insights into the storytelling and structure of the series for someone who may have little to no understanding of the show."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"0e13beb2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.13569Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.134946Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.149697Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.148464Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.027243,"end_time":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.152598","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-13T00:25:58.125355","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import
